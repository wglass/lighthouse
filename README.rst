Lighthouse is a service node discovery system written in python, built with
resilience, flexibility and ease-of-use in mind and inspired by Airbnb's
SmartStack_ solution.  Out of the box it supports discovery via Zookeeper_ with
cluster load balancing handled by an automatically configured HAProxy_.

Overview
~~~~~~~~~

A lighthouse setup consists of three parts running locally on each node: a load
balancer, the `lighthouse-writer` script and (usually) the `lighthouse-reporter`
script.

In a Lighthouse setup, no node's application code is aware of the existence of
other nodes, they talk to a local port handled by an instance of the load
balancer which in turn routes traffice among the various known other nodes.

This local load balancer is automatically updated when nodes come and go
via the `lighthouse-writer` script, which talks to the discovery method (e.g.
Zookeeper) to keep track of which nodes on which clusters are up.

The `lighthouse-reporter` script likewise talks to the discovery method, it
it is responsible for running health checks on any services on the local
node and reports to the discovery method that the healthy services are up
and the unhealthy ones are down.
