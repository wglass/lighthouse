    Base class for discovery method plugins.

    Unlike the `Balancer` base class for load balancer plugins, this discovery
    method plugin has several methods that subclasses are expected to define.

    Subclasses are used for both the writer process *and* the reporter process
    so each subclass needs to be able to report on individual nodes as well
    as monitor and collect the status of all defined clusters.

    It is important that the various instances of lighthouse running on various
    machines agree with each other on the status of clusters so a distributed
    system with strong CP characteristics is recommended.
