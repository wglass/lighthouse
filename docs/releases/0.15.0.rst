0.15.0
~~~~~~

  * Fixed a bug where HAProxy reloads weren't supplanting the existing processes

  * Fixed a bug where files with .yml as the extension were being ignored.

  * Config files for haproxy now live in a "balancers" subdirectory.

  * Completely revamped the logging system, logging is now configured via a
    "logging.yml" file at the root of the config directory.
