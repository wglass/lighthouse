* Revert update of the "balancer" nomenclature.  Any sort of updates to go beyond
  using load balancers is a long way off and it's best not to get ahead of
  ourselves.

* Update TCP check's query & response to be optional.  If both are omitted from
  a config, a simple successful connection will cause the check to pass.
